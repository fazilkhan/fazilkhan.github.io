After graduating from secondary school, she attended a trade school where she trained to be a seamstress. She met her husband Wilfred Haywood and married in 1968. Wilfred immigrated to the U.S. and the couple were reunited in New York City in 1969. Wilfred opened a dry cleaning business in Flatbush, Brooklyn, while Mavis stayed home to raise their three sons. Finances were tight at times but the Haywoods supported all three children throughout high school and college. Mavis enjoyed baking and was known for her signature Panamanian fruit cake. She supported over 20 different charities including the American Diabetes Association, Cheyenne River Indian Outreach and Shriners Hospitals for Children. Mavis worked as a home health aide in the 1990s, retiring in 2001. She later cared for her husband, Wilfred, after he was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia. Mavis fell ill with COVID-19 in April 2020 while at home in Brooklyn. She was hospitalized at Maimonides Medical Center and died on April 12, 2020, at the age of 75. A few weeks later, Wilfred developed pneumonia due to COVID-19. He died on May 25, 2020 at the age of 82. They were laid to rest next to each other at Rosehill Cemetery in New Jersey. The Haywoods are survived by their sons Wilfred, Kareem and Daniel and one grandson, Emmanuel.",She was a giving person.,"Wilfred Haywood Jr., Mavis Haywood’s son",Akshay Desai,8/27/2021 14:03:40,Mavis,,,Haywood,75,,4/12/2020,Brooklyn,,,,,Retired; Former Home Health Aide ,,https://www.forevermissed.com/mavis-eleanor-haywood/lifestory,Forever Missed,,,Haywood family,,,,Female,,Anjali Tsui,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08/27/2021,Jeffrey_Paley.jpg,"Shortly after Jeffrey Paley’s death, his wife Dr. Valerie Paley found a scrap of paper in a tray where he kept spare change. On it, he had scribbled down a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: “To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived, this is to have succeeded."" Jeffrey lived by these words. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, on Aug. 11, 1938, and adopted by William S. Paley, the founder and chairman of CBS Inc., and Dorothy (Hart) Hearst. He was raised on the Upper East Side and graduated from Harvard University in 1960. Jeffrey pursued three separate careers. He first worked as a journalist, reporting for The International Herald Tribune in Paris, where he eventually wrote a syndicated column about world affairs and the economy. In the early 1970s, he co-founded the Paley and Lowe Gallery in SoHo, which featured the work of young artists. His third and final career was as an independent private investor in the stock market. Jeffrey and Valerie met while living in the same apartment building in Greenwich Village. The couple married in 1989 and moved to the Upper East Side where they raised their son Austin and daughter Elianne. Jeffrey read the news voraciously — a passion that he maintained until his death. When he didn’t have to be in the city, he spent time with his family on Nantucket, where his ashes are buried. “In spite of his many accomplishments throughout his life, in the end he was most passionate about his family and kids,” Valerie said. He loved to read and play tennis, had a booming laugh and didn’t suffer fools, she added. Jeffrey died on Feb. 27, 2021, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center at the age of 82.","He was his own man. He was adopted into great privilege and certainly had many wonderful opportunities, but he wasn’t afraid to do things the hard way. He was passionate, intellectual, discerning, and a larger than life human being.","Dr. Valerie Paley, Jeffrey Paley’s wife",Madeline Muldoon,7/23/2021 15:37:02,Jeffrey,,,Paley,82,,2/27/2021,Manhattan,,,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/obituaries/jeffrey-paley-dead-coronavirus.html,New York Times,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JzoQaSqeYTpBXnc-XGTnzq0X2SCJADAA,"Valerie Paley, Jeffrey's Wife",,,,Male,,Maddie Muldoon,No,,,,,,,,,,,

After graduating from P.S. 45 in The Bronx and Cathedral College, a preparatory seminary, John joined St. Joseph’s Seminary. He was ordained at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in 1954 and served as a priest for more than six decades. John served as pastor at Our Lady of Mount Carmel in The Bronx from 1984 to 2008, then as senior priest at St. Joseph in New Rochelle until his retirement when he moved to the Edward Cardinal Egan Pavilion in Riverdale. He died on April 26, 2020, at the ​​Edward Cardinal Egan Pavilion, at the age of 93.","John was a people person and a family person. He was a very good priest, and a very good brother.

Worth, Jr. of Manhattan died, with his family by his side, on January 19, 2021 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Cause of death was complications of Covid-19. 
Theron Oscar Worth, Jr. hailed from a long line of English whaling captains, the family having arrived in Nantucket in the 1640's. Eventually, Toby's antecedents settled in Bridgehampton, NY, where Toby's grandfather and father are buried. There, Toby learned the game of tennis from his father, and a deep love of sailing and the Ocean, whose bounty provided so much to his ancestors. 

Toby is survived by his wife of 60 years, Merwin Braxton, his six children and 13 grandchildren, and his younger sister, Courtia Worth of Tillson, NY, and predeceased by his sister Edwina Worth Hatch of Bridgehampton, NY.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rodolfo Perez Acevedo was born in Panama and raised in Nicaragua. At the age of 10, he moved to Corona, Queens, with his parents and his brother, James. When he arrived, Acevedo spoke very little English. He later graduated from P.S. 73 and joined the Army at the age of 18. Acevedo served as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division for nearly 20 years. He then worked as a custodian for the U.S. Postal Service, retiring in 2003. Acevedo never married or had children but he dedicated much of his time to caring for his family, said his great-niece Samantha Silva. After his brother died in 1989, Acevedo stepped in as a father-figure and raised his nieces and nephews as if they were his own children, Silva said. He took them on trips to the park and to the zoo; taught them how to tie their shoes and ride bikes. Acevedo enjoyed collecting vinyl records, building model airplanes from his days as a paratrooper and watching classic movies. Acevedo died on April 1, 2020, at home. He was 74.","Rudy was a true patriot, in every sense of the word.","Samantha Silva, Rodolfo Perez Acevedo’s great-niece",Kenneth Heikes,6/28/2021 0:09:21,Rodolfo,Perez,Rudy,Acevedo,74,,4/1/2020,Queens,,,,,,,,Niece & Great Niece Interviews,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eqvDIKrFCUPB4VpyJh59yaOkNmOYfjg0,Avecedo Family,,,,Male,,Kenneth Heikes,No,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,7/22/2021,Jack_Smith.png,"Jack Smith’s passion, second to his family, was cars, said his daughter Jill Graney. He loved sports cars and owned them throughout his life. A month before he died, Jack fulfilled his dream of owning a Mercedes sports car. Born into a family of Polish immigrants in Toronto, Canada, Jack moved to Brooklyn at a young age, where he eventually met his wife Irene and raised his two daughters, Jill and Stacey. He was an accountant and spent his free time working on his car, building things out of wood and rooting for the Mets and Jets. Once his daughters were grown up, he and Irene moved to Lincroft, New Jersey, for a brief period. New Yorkers at heart, they soon moved back to the city and settled in Manhattan where Jack spent the last 18 years of his life. Jill said he was a quiet, soft-spoken man who loved being around friends and family, but never needed to be the center of attention. Jack was committed to helping others. After his retirement, he spent 16 years volunteering for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In 2010, he was given the Hospital Auxilian and Volunteer Achievement Award and was honored at a lunchtime ceremony at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Jill describes how her dad loved spending time with his daughters, their husbands and his five granddaughters, who were his proudest accomplishment. Jack died on April 16, 2020, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital at the age of 86. Shortly after he passed, his granddaughter Bo had a baby boy – the first boy in the family – who she named “Dylan Jack” after her grandfather.","He was a good guy, and everybody knew he was. He never said a bad word, and had a lot of friends who all had nice things to say about him.","Jill Graney, Jack Smith’s daughter ",Madeline Muldoon,6/22/2021 16:33:35,Jack,,,Smith,86,,4/16/2020,Manhattan,,,  .  ,,,,https://www.weinsteinchapels.com/schedule-of-services/jack-smith-2/,Weinstein Memorial Chapel,Unknown,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rdFJ3XTlQCJAGH0wikcQ4UUEEqSn44Ht,"Jill Graney, Jack's daughter","Survived by his wife Irene, his daughters Jill and Stacey, and his five granddaughters",,,Male,,Maddie Muldoon,No,,,,,,,,,,,

Ryan started his own website, the Manhattan Digest and later worked for Instinct Magazine. He was a food critic and interviewed celebrities like Glen Close, Fran Dresher, Seth Rogan and stars from “Real Housewives.” In 2013, he covered the MTV awards from the red carpet. Ryan had “the best sense of humor,” Megan said. “He could make anyone laugh.” Shea was a big foodie who loved to travel, try new restaurants and watch RuPaul’s drag race and “Real Housewives.” He was especially close to his sister and nephew Eddie, taking him to the Cheesecake factory and build-a-bear.

After playing football for Drake University in Iowa, Naughton moved back to New York where he worked at Mount Vernon High School for almost 40 years. Naughton was a special education teacher and coached football, girls’ basketball and girls’ track teams. He also served as a basketball referee. Naughton’s students loved and admired him, nicknaming him “Big O” or “Big Naught.” In 2015, he was inducted into the Westchester Hall of Fame for football. At 6-foot-4, Naughton was a huge presence, said his fiancée Gladys Mitchell. When the two met at the Greater Centennial A.M.E. Zion Church, Naughton already had five children. Mitchell’s three daughters called him their “bonus” dad as he treated them just as if they were his own. In his spare time, Naughton loved listening to music, especially Tupac and DMX. He also loved listening to Mitchell sing and said he was her number one fan. Naughton enjoyed singing in church and was part of the men’s choir. He also loved dancing and watching TV shows like “In the Heat of the Night” or “Superman.” Naughton died Feb. 24, 2021, at the age of 63. He is survived by his fiancée Gladys Mitchell, five children, Mitchell’s three daughters, 12 grandchildren and six siblings.","He was such a peacemaker, a gentle giant.","Gladys Mitchell, Carlton Naughton Sr.’s fiancée",Nicole Masuoka,6/17/2021 14:55:36,Carlton,,,Naughton,63,Sr.,2/24/2021,,,,,,,,,,"Diabetes, Cancer",,,,,,Male,,Felipe Pardo,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ramon_Furcal.jpg,"Ramon Furcal was born in Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic in 1966. At the age of 16, Furcal immigrated to the United States with his mother and settled in Washington Heights in Manhattan in an apartment in which he would live for the rest of his life. Furcal worked in construction, hiring himself out as a painter, carpenter and general contractor. His true passion, said his cousin Katira Cepeda, was “to live life to the fullest.” Furcal enjoyed traveling, visiting family and friends, spending time by the ocean, fishing and cooking. He spent several months a year in the Dominican Republic, where his mother now lives part-time and in Florida where his aunt, Cepeda’s mother, currently lives. When he was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, it took Furcal’s family two days to locate him, said Cepeda, because he did not have access to his cell phone. Furcal remained hospitalized for over 30 days, during which time his family was unable to visit. His mother, who had traveled to New York from the Dominican Republic, was only able to see her son after he died, Cepeda added. Furcal died May 19, 2020, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights. He is survived by his mother, father and son, as well as a large extended family. ","Ramon was always ready for any new adventure. His motto was to live life without any cares or any concerns about what others might think. Living, loving and laughing describes everything he embodied and more. If only we had had more time together.","Katira Cepeda, Ramon Furcal’s cousin",Talia Bloch,6/9/2021 12:21:12,Ramon,,,Furcal,53,,5/19/2020,Manhattan,,,,,Construction Worker and Contractor,,,,Diabetes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P0r7b2BAueWsP_rJ7Dz0tRu6oQaE-mbg,Katira Cepeda,"Contact was cousin, Katira Cepeda.

A matriarch in her family, church and community, she was “a small woman with a big presence,” said her granddaughter, Shardi White. Johnson was a deacon at Bethany Baptist Church in Harlem. She took pride in her role in the community and was one of a few female role models in the church. The church community was her extended family where she was known as “Mom,” especially to members whose parents had died. As part of her role, Johnson attended seminary school to become a chaplain, learning to pray with people as their family and friends were dying. Each week, Johnson looked forward to her Bible study group and spending time with family and friends. She called loved ones to check in each day and her home was a gathering place for holidays and special occasions with her children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Johnson died on April 23, 2020, at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 82.","She was the person who was there for everybody, and she never wanted to stop doing things.

He moved to New York City at 18, searching for new opportunities. He started working immediately, picking strawberries, coffee and beans in the surrounding farmland. In New York, Agron reunited with his two older brothers and was later joined by his mother and younger siblings. In 1994, he met Elizabeth Cubero and quickly became a father figure to her two children, Jeffrey and Anthony. They later married and enjoyed spending time together, watching movies and taking trips. Agron later worked as a butcher. He was proud of the work he’d done to support his family and hoped to retire to Florida. He contracted COVID-19 in April 2020 and was hospitalized after losing consciousness. He died later that day on April 19, 2020, at NYU Langone Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 60 years old.","He was such a teddy bear. We did everything together — he was the rock of the family and such a humble person, my children and I were so blessed to have him in our lives.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,08/17/2021,Cesar_Morales.JPG,"Born and raised in San Pedro de Marcorís, Dominican Republic, Cesar Augusto Morales Sr. was the “man of the house” supporting his family from a young age, said his daughter, Annais Morales. Before turning five, he helped his single mother deliver milk and sell newspapers, Annais said. Cesar fought in the Dominican Civil War of 1965 alongside the Constitutionalists who were attempting to reinstate former President Juan Bosch who had been overthrown by a military coup. After a new government took power, Cesar endured several attempts on his life from political enemies, his family said, and fled to the U.S. in 1967. He settled in East Harlem where he worked as a handyman and carpenter. Cesar later moved to The Bronx and lived there for 50 years. Cesar had 10 children, 24 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. He instilled a “go-getter” attitude in his children, Annais said. One memorable lesson: When she turned 18, Annais asked her father for a cell phone and he said no. Although he could have bought it for her, his refusal taught her the value of a hard-earned dollar. “It forced me to go out and get a job...and I got myself a nice little cell phone,” she said. Even as a senior citizen on a fixed income, Cesar donated to charities like The Wounded Warriors Project and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Cesar loved traveling to the Dominican Republic to be with family and friends. “He was always out and about … it’s like I had a 25-year-old for a dad,” Annais said. He died April 15, 2020, at Lincoln Hospital at the age of 89.","He was just so full of life, so funny, so charming, so generous and so smart.","Annais Morales, Cesar Augusto Morales Sr.'s daughter",Kenny Dao,5/26/2021 15:01:30,Cesar,Augusto,,Morales,89,Sr.,4/15/2020,Bronx,,,,,,,,,,,Morales Family,online searched but no relevant links besides Bronx Borough President Link,,,Male,,Joy Lee (volunteer),Yes,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alexander_Tabarovsky.png,"Alexander Tabarovsky was born in Kiev in the former Soviet Union in 1928, the eldest of three brothers. His early life was overshadowed by World War II, with his Jewish family attempting to flee eastward to avoid the Nazi army. One of their initial attempts was by ferry. However, Tabarovsky was finishing a soccer game with his friends, causing him and his family to miss the ferry. This saved their life, as the boat sank, killing everyone on board. His family eventually managed to flee to safety in Siberia. His love of sports had saved his life, and while Tabarovskywas interested in a variety of sports, he created a career out of one in particular: table tennis. Tabarovsky served as a table tennis coach for decades, coaching the Soviet Union’s women’s table tennis champion in 1969, Svetlana Grinberg. Despite his success in the Soviet Union, mounting antisemitism forced him to flee, his family said. In the 1980s, Tabarovsky immigrated to the U.S., reuniting with his brother who had moved to New York City years earlier. He settled in Brighton Beach and quickly became a fixture in the Brooklyn community, living in the same two buildings for decades. Tabarovsky contracted COVID-19 in early May 2020 and was hospitalized. He died May 18, 2020, a day after his wife’s birthday. He is survived by his wife, two children, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",He was the glue that held our family together.,"Jane Baraz, Alexander Tabarovsky’s granddaughter ",Akshay Desai,5/6/2021 17:53:46,Alexander,,,Tabarovsky,91,,5/18/2020,Brooklyn,"Brighton Beach Ave, Brooklyn",11235.0,,,Tennis coach (retired),Soviet Union,,,No underlying conditions,,Tabarovsky family,,,,Male,,Akshay Desai,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jose_Jaramillo.jpeg,"When José “Pepe” Jaramillo was growing up in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, he used to point to airplanes in the sky and tell his family: “I’m going to be on that plane one day.” He saved his money and, by 1968, at the age of 18, had enough to make his way to Jackson Heights, Queens where he lived with his godmother, Maria. José found a job as a plumber and settled into life in New York. “He was known as the cool guy. He was the ‘Fonzie’ … ‘El Puma,’” said his daughter Jennifer Jaramillo. José caught the attention of an Ecuadorian woman named Ana who had come to the United States from Guayaquil to study to become a doctor. The two married in 1971 and, a year later, had the first of five children. He was a strict father, said Jennifer, “but he would listen and he would always let us speak.” José was also a gentleman and a good dresser, his family said. In the spring of 2020, family members started to fall ill with COVID-19, including José. He was admitted to NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital Queens and later transferred to Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where he died on June 1, 2020. He was 69 years old.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Michael_O'Connor.jpeg,"Michael Xavier O’Connor was born and was raised in Bronxville, in Westchester County. He graduated from Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts with a degree in theater and history. In 1993, O’Connor returned to New York to focus on his acting career. He was an active member of several performance unions, including SAG-AFTRA, AEA and IATSE. O’Connor was an animal rights activist and loved his cat, Lucy, his friends said. “Michael was an inspiration to everyone he met with his unconditional inclusiveness,” said Carol-Marie Labozzetta, his friend. O’Connor was constantly working towards achieving the “best version” of himself, she said, and he loved learning, reading and traveling. Labozzetta fondly recalled traveling to Ireland together, where O’Connor explored his heritage. O’Connor was also a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees. He died on March 15, 2021, in his home in Astoria, Queens, at the age of 56.","When Michael loved, he loved unconditionally.","Carol-Marie Labozzetta, Michael O’Connor’s friend",Kaitlyn Patterson,4/28/2021 19:40:07,Michael,X.,,O'Connor,56,,3/15/2021,Queens,,11103.0,,,,,,,High blood pressure,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rx7hP29_rmxwLkrWk0ByBnchD_GCK4VV,Carol-Marie Labozzetta,,,,Male,,Kaitlyn Patterson,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,,James_Weber.jpeg,"James H. Weber was a man of letters and learning. Known as “Shamus” to his family and friends, he attended Yale in the 1960s, where he studied English, art history and classical languages. He went on to spend the next 50 years of his life teaching — most of those years at Westover School. “Shamus was a beloved teacher to multiple generations,"" said Liz Van Hoose, a former student. “Having himself studied with W.H. Auden, he imbued us with the force of poetry. His favorite Auden quatrain, from ‘The Fall of Rome,’ fortifies me still in times of overwhelming hardship: Altogether elsewhere, vast / Herds of reindeer move across / Miles and miles of golden moss, / Silently and very fast.” A passionate and skilled sailor, he once crewed for the accomplished Harry C. “Buddy” Melges. But Shamus’s lifelong passion was his wife, Cynthia Weber, to whom he first proposed marriage at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago in 1951 when they were children growing up together. Eleven years and two proposals later, Cynthia said yes. They were married for 53 years. He died April 1, 2020, at the Cobble Hill Health Center, a nursing home in Brooklyn. Shamus is survived by his wife, Cynthia; two sons, Harley Weber and Clark Weber; three grandchildren; and an Airedale terrier named Zeno.",Teaching was his passion.

After being widowed, she left an abusive second marriage and raised her daughter, Carmen Delia, as a single mother, her family said. In 1967, she became the first in her family to move to the United States. Abreu arrived in New York City in the winter with a few dollars and a pair of kitten heels, according to her granddaughter, Ramona Ferreyra. She became a seamstress and eventually retired to Mitchel Houses in the Bronx, where she enjoyed playing dominoes and bingo with friends. Ferreyra described her as a “comedian” and “reluctant activist.” She died Dec. 29, 2020, from liver failure after contracting COVID-19 at the age of 89.

Adorno was a tall man often confused for a professional football player, and was nicknamed “Tiny” for its irony, said his son Jefferey. Adorno attended Samuel Gompers High School before joining the military in the 1950s. He served in the Korean War and played basketball and baseball for the U.S. Marines. He later worked in the air conditioning and refrigeration business, starting as a truck driver before he was promoted to management at the warehouse. Adorno often ran into his many friends who would yell out: “Hey, Tiny!” Adorno encouraged his two sons and their friends to pursue the arts and music, supporting their band gigs in the tri-state area by providing equipment and transportation. “This was just his natural way of being —  to help people, not part of a grander plan,” said his son Jefferey. Adorno died on April 3, 2020, at Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital at the age of 88.","My father-in-law was this family man and all the women loved him. He was a gentle giant, he was a gentleman, almost like a James Bond: calm, cool and collected.

She “would listen to you and just tell you what she thinks,” he said, “And most of the time, people would end up agreeing with her. They would say, ‘Yeah, Judy, actually, you’re right.’” She was a “joker” and part of “the generation who liked to make provocative jokes,” he added.

After the stock market crashed, Norensberg shifted his career and worked for the city in the Administration for Children’s Service, retiring as assistant commissioner. Norensberg’s greatest joy came from watching his family — especially his seven children and 20 grandchildren — succeed. He celebrated each accomplishment with the same fervor “whether it was a kindergarten play or a wedding,” said his son, Avi. Norensberg showed up for his family when they needed him most, visiting a grandchild in the NICU six days a week for her brief life, and welcoming a son into his home who was recovering from addiction. He was affectionately known among his friends and community as “Tatty,” a Yiddish word reserved for beloved parents. Norensberg married Sydney Norensberg in 1963, and they were together for 56 years. A leader of the Bais Yisroel Torah Center and follower of Rabbi Avigdor Miller, Norensberg studied the bible rigorously, his son said.

He was humble and blessed everyone with kindness and generosity, said his daughter, Jael Tusa. “He was so down to Earth…He always cared about people so much, even if they hurt him.” Tusa brought his family flowers on Valentine’s Day, Mother's Day and anniversaries, she said. He would often say: “I would be nothing without you guys.” Tusa began studying civics questions for the U.S. naturalization test a year before he booked his appointment. He passed and became a U.S. citizen in 2017 — a major personal milestone, which brought him joy, his family said. “He sent us all a selfie next to the American flag,” Jael said. Tusa died April 29, 2020, at Mount Sinai Queens at the age of 54. He is survived by his wife Gloria Quinga; daughters Evelin Tusa, Jael Tusa and Britney Tusa; and grandchildren Mateo Sanchez and Abby Sanchez.","He always taught us family is key to everything. He would always say, ‘If one of us goes, we all go.’ So, anywhere we went we were always all together.","Jael Tusa, daughter of Leonel Tusa",Gabriel Sandoval,4/14/2021 11:12:41,Leonel,,,Tusa Masaquiza,54,,4/29/2020,Queens,,,,,,,https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-loving-memory-of-leonel-g-tusa-masaquiza,,,https://drive.google.com/open?id=16fkPD_lLnj7hW0tg3Pnm2JO-KVXDib7n,Jael Tusa,,,,Male,,Gabriel Sandoval,No,,,,,,,,,,,

After graduating from high school, Cruz was hired at Gouverneur Hospital as a secretary and worked her way up over the course of 38 years to serve as a patient advocate. Her son, Rafael Viera, said Cruz was “a little spicy” and “had an edge to her” because of her passion for her work in underserved communities.

Cruz became a grandmother while still raising her youngest daughter. Whatever she did for her children, she did for her grandkids, said her daughter, Kristina Cruz. She often doted on her family. One Christmas, her daughter said, the family agreed to a “secret Santa” but Cruz couldn’t help herself and broke the rules, giving presents to everyone.

Joel taught him to build his own bicycles and enrolled him in the Boy Scouts and hockey. “I was probably one of the worst players, but you would never know it by my dad watching me play. He was one of the only ones screaming.” Joel worked for the MTA for 32 years and did everything from cleaning the stations to renewing subway tracks. In 2015, as he was retiring, James passed the MTA’s entry exam and began his own underground career. Joel was honest about the challenges his son would face on the job but proud that a second generation was following in his footsteps. Like hundreds of other MTA employees, James was infected with COVID-19. Although he recovered, his father, with whom he shared a home in Marine Park, got worse.

On Sept 11, 2001, Crowe was working with the Department of Homeland Security in downtown Manhattan when the Twin Towers collapsed. After responding to the attacks, Crowe beat cancer twice, Higgins said, and suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Higgins said the illnesses may have been triggered by his work at Ground Zero, which involved searching through the hazardous rubble for survivors. Crowe died December 7, 2020, at the age of 77.","[John was] well liked, well respected, just a stand up guy, a real cops’ cop.","Heidi Higgins-Sermabekia, John Crowe’s cousin",Scooty Nickerson,2/16/2021 13:50:46,John,,,Crowe,77,,12/7/2020,Bronx,,,,,Supervisory Special Agent,Department of Homeland Security,https://www.wymanfisher.com/obituary/John-Crowe,Wyman Fisher,"Cancer, Chronic lung disease",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pbvGCWmuc1slKA47-Kzv5cpP6pSej3E-,Heidi Higgins-Sermabekia cousin,,,,Male,,Scooty Nickerson,No,,,,,,,,,,,

He was assigned to FDNY Station 26, where he trained hundreds of new recruits, including FDNY Capt. Lorena Conception-Martinez. Stone was a strict but effective instructor who cared deeply about those he trained, Conception-Martinez remembers. “Every time I got promoted he made it a point to go to every one of my ceremonies,” Conception-Martinez said. Although Stone helped respond to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he did not talk openly about his experience, she added. After retiring from the FDNY, Stone served as a safety, security and emergency preparedness specialist in Rockland County, N.Y. Stone died April 28, 2020, at the age of 67.","He was always there for me, especially once I became an officer … He taught me the dos and don’ts and how to and how to be fair.","FDNY Capt.

Under threat of persecution by the Nazis, Wolf’s family escaped the country the night before Kristallnacht, or the night of broken glass, and found refuge in Switzerland. Wolf worked at the American consulate in Zurich during World War II, witnessing the Nuremberg trials in 1946 as a translator. He then worked in a Cold War intelligence project for the U.S. Army in Germany. Wolf emigrated to New York City and transitioned to the textile industry, launching a fashion manufacturing business. After the business closed in 2005, he was forced to pivot and found a way to help fellow Holocaust survivors through the Blue Card, the country’s only non-profit organization dedicated to providing financial assistance to low-income Holocaust survivors. In his spare time, Wolf organized concerts for the elderly with Juilliard students. He took care of his wife, Beth, née Horelick, until she died in 2015.

A lifelong New Yorker, Jaeger was born in Brooklyn at Bushwick Hospital and spent most of his life in Glendale, Queens. Jaeger was a history buff who enjoyed reading historical fiction novels and visiting historical sites with his family. Over the years, Jaeger took his children, Elizabeth and Gary Jr., to sites throughout the U.S., including several National Parks. One of the last gifts Jaeger gave his grandson was a scratch map of the National Parks. “When most people go on vacation it's a time to relax and rest. Not Daddy,” his daughter said. Jaeger was an important figure in the life of his youngest namesake, Gary III. From rides at Disney World to speaking to Gary’s class on career day, Jaeger was, “always present,” Elizabeth said. Since retiring from his job as a programmer with New York Life Insurance, Jaeger and his wife, Toni, enjoyed traveling the world on cruise ships. They had just returned from one when Jaeger became sick. Jaeger’s family was unable to be with him when he died. They said goodbye over FaceTime. Gary III made a goodbye video for his grandfather that caregivers played for him before he died.

He immigrated to the United States in 1984 after meeting his wife, Sally, in the Cancun airport. She was trying to rent a car and he was selling transport tickets. He called her the next day and, after two dates, suggested she delay her flight home. “He said, ‘We’re getting along so well, why don’t you stay another week?’” Sally said. She did. A week later she returned to her home in Florida just long enough to pack her bags to move to Mexico. Though Ollarvide had a degree in drafting when he moved to the U.S., some of his first jobs were working at a fruit stand and as a busboy in a hotel restaurant. He eventually started his own drafting company and became an American citizen in 1999. He had been receiving cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering but was improving when he contracted COVID-19. He played golf twice a week with the same group of friends; was in a men’s tennis league; and ran his business remotely throughout his treatment. Ollarvide was a favorite at his local bar and was described as a jokester, his family said. He often used the hashtag #Juaninamillion on his social media posts, which his family and friends adopted as their own. Ollarvide died April 20 at Harlem Hospital at the age of 60.

A resident of Brooklyn, Kabir was born in 1962 in Newark, N.J. He attended Weequahic High School there and graduated with a business degree from New Jersey City University. He worked as a drug counselor in New York City and was the father of eight children and grandfather of 15. As an outgrowth of his Muslim faith, he changed his name from Reginald Williams in the early 2000s, and he spent his free time at the masjid. He loved conversation, and he attuned himself to his grandchildren’s interests. They called him Poppy or Pop-Pop. “He could talk to you about anything, from religion to ancient history to current events,” said his daughter. Friends and family didn’t know Kabir was sick, but when they couldn’t reach him during Easter weekend, they began calling hospitals. By the time they managed to talk to him, via iPad, he was on life support. They spent two hours reminiscing and saying goodbye. Kabir died at Brooklyn Hospital Center on April 22.

Specializing in hard-edge paintings, Kaplan exhibited his work five times at the 55 Mercer Street Gallery, which he helped to establish in 1969. His work was recognized with grants from the Adolph & Esther Gottlieb Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Kaplan combined his painting career with his leftist politics through his membership with the Art Workers' Coalition, a collective of artists, writers and critics who advocated for economic, political and social reforms at New York City’s museums. He also taught a new generation of artists at several colleges and universities. A Brooklyn native, Kaplan called SoHo home before moving to the Hebrew Home in Riverdale. There, friends say, the 84-year-old regaled fellow residents with funny stories and a sharp wit. At the time of his death, Kaplan continued to paint, working on a series dedicated to his longtime partner. He died April 17 at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Yonkers.","When I first met him, he was basically a painter. Then, he got interested in writing. He did a lot of writing.

,,,,,,,,,True,TRUE,,,,,Jay_Galst.jpg,"Born and raised in Milwaukee, Dr. Jay Martin Galst moved to New York City in the 1970s to attend medical school at Columbia University. After receiving his degree, he set up a private practice in Manhattan, which he ran for decades. At a young age, Dr. Galst developed an interest in coin collecting, a passion that he continued to pursue throughout his life, becoming an expert in coins related to the eye (as well as those from Judea). He wrote a 574-page book on the subject titled “Ophthalmologia, Optica et Visio in Nummis.” He was a clinical professor at New York Medical College and past president and longtime board member of the New York Numismatic Club. Dr. Galst and his wife, psychologist Joann Paley Galst, met as children and became best friends while working on their high school yearbook. Dr. Galst was drawn to ophthalmology by the concrete nature and specificity of the field, she said, viewing the eyes as “a window to the well-being of a person.” As someone who valued family, Dr. Galst often saw patients across generations, treating the children of those who had first come to him when they were young themselves. Dr. Galst died April 12 at the age of 69 at NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan. He is survived by his wife, their son, and two grandchildren, one of whom was born shortly after his death.","He was the ultimate mensch, a very kind and generous person who gave of his time to anyone who needed or wanted it. He was still in touch with his friends from years ago, even his best friends from kindergarten and high school.

In her youth, she studied to be a fashion designer, though gave up her studies and took on duties as a caretaker when her three children were born.

The reference to a previous address in Puerto Rico could connect to the MRNY obituary, which notes that Ms. Perez "". . . was a pioneer of our family in the USA"", perhaps indicating that she immigrated to the US.

The obituary on MRNY was written by Mr. Mena's child (one of his children); he also has grand children. Mr. Mena's child in the MRNY obituary said, ""My dad was the best man in the world, a good father, a good grandfather, adorable, loved by everyone who knew him. He was my world and has left a void in me that nothing and no one can ever fill.""",,,Male,,Phyllis Kaufman,No,,Brooklyn,Brooklyn,NY,Ridgewood Ave,,,,,,

Please also note that I was unable to upload Mr. Ortiz's photo from MRNY (it already appears on the volunteer Google doc-- I was not able to find any other photos). 

The only white pages search that seems to provide a relevant resource for Carlos Ortiz at 370 Bushwick Avenue, Apartment 1G, Brooklyn, NY 11206-3733, 718.573.0944. The age range could be accurate (75). The list of relatives linked Carlos Ortiz to Gloria Ortiz. Gloria Ortiz’s age range could be accurate (67), and I was able to find a marriage license for Carlos Ortiz and Gloria Ortiz in 1963. I was not able to find any relevant searches for Gloria Ortiz. this is the address that I listed above.

I found this alternative address on Spokeo for Mr. Ortiz, and the age range could be appropriate: Carlos Ortiz— age 86, Briggs Avenue, Yonkers, NY; previous address in Bronx NY-- https://www.spokeo.com/Carlos-Ortiz/New-York/Yonkers/p3742144441 

The obituary on MRNY is from his wife, who says that they were married for 50 years. Mr. Oriz's wife says, ""I have great sadness in my heart because I could not be with him in his last moments, it hurts me very much not to have been present. I was married 50 years and him dying in that condition is very frustrating.""

,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,2/23/21,Kimberly_Wetzel.jpg,"Kimberly Wetzel was known by many names — Kimasaki, Aunty Kim and, most often, Kim. She grew up with her mom, Judy, and brother, Marty, in Pennsylvania. Her love for travel and languages brought her to years of living abroad in Poland, London and Nicaragua, teaching English as a foreign language, and, for the last 15 years, working in NYU’s Office of Global Services. She lived in Brooklyn with her two beloved “copy cats,” Carbon and Ditto. Kim found a group of close friends in the Sirens, New York City’s oldest women’s motorcycle club. Two New York City benches are dedicated in her memory — one in Green-Wood Cemetery, where she frequently spent time with friends and took night photography classes, and one in Washington Square Park, near her work. The plaque in Green-Wood reads: “Beloved friend, storyteller, motorcyclist, photographer, artist, baker, musician, and adventurer. She loved cats, squirrels, Sirens MC, and Green-Wood.” After a rescue attempt that had friends, neighbors, and family from across the country coordinating to get into her apartment, and successfully got her to a hospital, she died on March 29, 2020, at the age of 50.","We were all just blown away by how much she impacted people on a one-on-one level.

Nancy was a direct descendant of two of Staten Island's early families, the Perines and the Manees, who settled around 1661.  She was born in Staten Island, where she attended Tottenville High School, then moved to the Bronx, she worked as a crossing guard, a waitress and then at Irving Trust Co. in Manhattan. After her retirement, she moved to Vermont and finally to Pompton Lakes, N.J.

He grew up on the Lower East Side on Avenue C and attended Seward Park High School. He enlisted in the armed forces and proudly served in the Army Air Corps in Saipan as a mechanic working in the B52 bomber division. Upon his return, he migrated to Miami Beach where he met Margaret Benneche on the beach, fell in love and married. She was from Bay Ridge and they returned to New York where they raised their family. Louis spent the next 40 years working for the NYCHA as a plasterer and a foreman. He died March 30 and was laid to rest next to his wife and son on August 20, 2020, which would have been his 100th birthday. He is survived by his daughter, Susan Chevel, his grandchildren, Tracy and Stephen as well as his great grandchildren, Grace and Christian. ","My father was the kindest gentleman I ever met.

Barbato Jr. was born and raised in Tomkinsville, attended Curtis High School and moved to Westerleigh in the early 1970s, where he lived until his death. After graduating high school, Barbato went into carpentry and founded his own contracting company, LJB Associates. A craftsman and designer, Barbato was nicknamed “MacGyver” by those who knew him, because “he could build or fix anything,” said his daughter, Jennifer DeMeo. After a decade running LJB, Barbato became a design contractor for a national chain of cosmetology schools. In the 1990s, he went on to join the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development as a building inspector. Ever social, Barbato enjoyed traveling, dining out, and attending Broadway shows. He also took pleasure in teaching others woodworking and often had projects going in the homes of neighbors and friends. When he was a young man, Barbato once passed a burning house on his way to work, and made sure that everyone inside escaped. “He did whatever he could to help people, whoever it was: neighbor, friend, family member, stranger,” his daughter said. After retiring 11 years ago, Barbato took a part-time maintenance job at a funeral home, where he was most likely exposed to the novel coronavirus. Barbato died April 7 at the age of 74 at Staten Island University Hospital. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Jean (DePete), two daughters, five grandchildren and two great-granddaughters.","My dad’s motto was ‘family first.’ He had a tattoo of it in Italian on his wrist, ‘familia prima.’ And for him, everyone was family.

After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he helped remove debris from Ground Zero, working “relentlessly,"" his family said. He grew up in Ozone Park, Queens; married his wife, Janet, in 1980; and settled in Richmond Hill before moving to Long Island, where he and Janet lived for about 35 years. He decorated one room of his home with Yankee and Elvis memorabilia and was a dedicated member of the Mustang and Shelby Club, where he won first prize for his Mustang. During his drive-by funeral, the street was filled with friends, neighbors and passersby. He died April 2 at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip at the age of 62.","Frank was one of the hardest working men you could know. He was all about his family. He was generous. He would lend a hand to anybody at the drop of a hat, without question.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ezzard_Christopher.jpg,"Ezzard Christopher, also known as Burnham, was a man who would greet everyone with a “Hey man, how are you?” according to his wife, Megan Christopher. He had a passion for dancing, especially Caribbean-style ballroom dancing and could be found many Friday nights at the Guyanese social club in his neighborhood, dancing and playing dominos. He and his wife competed in many Guyanese dance competitions where they frequently returned home with trophies. “I remember as a little girl growing up, him teaching me how to dance and waltzing on his feet as he taught me the box movements and where to hold my hands,” said his daughter, Angel Christopher. A bauxite mining foreman from Guyana, he immigrated to Brooklyn in 1988 with his wife and daughter. He worked for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection for more than 25 years, first machining then moving through the ranks to become a water filtration engineer. Over the years, the DEP shifted to a digitized testing system, which he learned how to use. “He was determined not to let a new technology push him out of his career,” his daughter said. He loved to travel and frequently sent money back to Guyana. He died April 2 at a hospital in Brooklyn at the age of 68. He was the oldest of 11 children and the father to five children: Nigel, Sheldon, Rawle, Gavin and Angel.","He was always smiling, always joking, always shaking and hugging people. He was definitely the life of the party.","Angel Christopher, Ezzard Christopher’s daughter",Kayce Stevens,9/22/2020 21:40:46,Ezzard,,Burnham,Christopher,68,,4/2/2020,Brooklyn,,11236.0,,,,NYC Department of Environmental Protection,,,No underlying conditions,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_hwtPXRYy9wOULu8qO166yPZd1OmAopm,,,,,Male,,Kayce Stevens,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1/14/21,Michael_Dimin.JPG,"Michael Dimin grew up on Long Island surrounded by boats and fishing before settling in Brooklyn and founding the sustainable seafood company Sea to Table. During a family vacation in Tobago in the late 1990s, Dimin had gone fishing with a local fisherman and caught a boat load of fish. Upon returning to port, Dimin realized all the other boats had caught the same amount of fish, and with no refrigeration on the island, there was no way they could sell all of their fish before it spoiled. Thus was the start of Dimin’s vision to create a way to connect fishermen with people who wanted to eat better fish. In 2010, his vision became reality and his family business began with three employees. “He made everyone work harder because he could trace [the source of] the fish he sold and others couldn’t always say the same,” said his friend and former colleague, Holley Atkinson. Dimin valued his employees, appreciated their opinions and made Sea To Table a fun place to work, she said. “As an employee, you really felt like you were part of the family,” Atkinson said. Dimin died April 13 at his mother’s home in Point Lookout, N.Y., at the age of 67. He is survived by five children, Daniel, Katie, Sean, Alex and Philip, and numerous grandchildren.","Michael had an outrageous exuberance.

At the age of 9, he left Williston, S.C., and moved to Brooklyn with his father. He became a star athlete, leading his high school basketball team to a championship game at Madison Square Garden. Thompson played college basketball in Kansas and, after graduating, worked at the Walt Whitman Houses, a NYCHA housing complex in Fort Greene. “He had a very deep feeling for his people, and people who were poor,” said his wife of more than 40 years, Dolores B. Thompson. Thompson, known to his students as “Mr. T or JT,” worked as a teacher in a daycare center and later in a classroom support role at PS 67 for 40 years. Often, before his shift started, he’d ride his bike from his home in Prospect Heights to Fort Greene so he could greet each child at the school breakfast program. Outside of class, Thompson loved to sing or “hit the notes,” as he’d say. He helped establish the Fort Greene Council Inc. with his mentor Sam Pinn Jr., lobbying for more Black stewardship of community institutions, namely care centers for children and seniors, and worked with Brooklyn CORE (Congress on Racial Equity). Thompson died May 17 at the Cobble Hill Care Center, after suffering from kidney failure, Alzheimer’s and finally Covid-19. His wife was by his side as he died. “I had all his music on the iPod.

As a kid, Agovino teamed up with his cousin, Danny, to cut Mets coupons out of milk cartons until they saved enough to attend a game, said his sisterm Toni Agovino. He was also fascinated by trains. Agovino loved the city’s subways and had a special knack for giving his friends and family exact instructions on how to navigate the MTA system. Agovino once competed on “The $64,000 Question,” a television quiz show in the 1960s and drove a taxi through the late 1980s. He had a wicked sense of humor, his sister said, and loved hanging out with his family. “He had a special relationship with each one of us,” she said. Agovino enjoyed going to baseball games with his brother and he remembered all of his siblings’ birthdays. One of his greatest accomplishments was taking care of his elderly mother. Agovino died April 4 at Jacobi Hospital at the age of 67. He is survived by four siblings and many nieces, nephews and aunts.",J.R. was a rare diamond in this world.,"Toni Agovino, Alphonse Agovino’s sister",Kynala Phillips,7/30/2020 15:13:28,Alphonse,Junior,J.R.,Agovino,67,,4/4/2020,Bronx,2872 Harrington Ave,10461.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,Male,,Caroline Leddy,Yes,,Bronx,Bronx,NY,2872 Harrington Ave,,10461.0,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Anthony_C_Dazzo.JPG,"Anthony C. Dazzo was all about the little things. Before his daughter, Lauren Dazzo-Hanley, left the house, he would check her tires and warn her to back out slowly and look for nails. A doting grandfather, Dazzo hid toys in between couch cushions, so his youngest grandchild wouldn’t put them in her mouth. He’d leave folded up paper towels all over his daughter's house, just in case he needed one. When someone needed a ride, the answer was always yes, even if it meant waiting in the car for hours. Dazzo loved to cook meals for his family, even as he battled with Parkinson’s disease, and he insisted on making oatmeal for his grandchildren, his family said. A few months before Dazzo died, his daughter noticed that he started singing, “Skip To My Lou” including the chorus: “Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, shoo, shoo.” Dazzo died April 9 at the age of 73.","He was the most gentle man I know, patient, honest, a great cook.","Lauren Dazzo-Hanley, Anthony C.

He studied at Bowdoin College and graduated with a Ph.D. from Columbia University, before working for President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Federal Reserve Board. Kotsonis eventually worked on Wall Street for Kidder Peabody and, in 1968, returned to Greece in order to manage industrial investments, where he felt he was needed, his family said. Kotsonis died May 9 at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Washington Heights at the age of 89.","We wanted him nearby as he got older so that we could take care of him. We couldn't because of the hospital rules. Still, he spent some good years near us.

She settled in Bushwick, where she lived for more than 40 years. Bush worked as a social worker for the city government in Brooklyn, where she helped New Yorkers find work, apply for food stamps and housing.

,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,Laura_TaylorHowell.jpg,"Born in Berkeley County, S.C., in 1946, Laura Taylor Howell lived in the south most of her life, raising three children there. In the 1990s, she packed up the kids and headed to New York City. There, she met Clifton Howell, a tailor and homecare aid who worked in her building. The two got married, settling in The Bronx. “Everyone thinks their mom is the greatest mom, but I think she wins the award,” said her daughter, Marisa Taylor. She worked multiple jobs to make sure “we were going to have a great Christmas and a great birthday.” Among her talents and vocations: health care worker, jewelry maker, cupcake baker, teddy-bear fixer, jokester, cancer survivor and deacon at Lowly Nazarene Baptist Church in The Bronx, where she sang in the choir. Shortly after the coronavirus made its way into the city, Laura developed symptoms and was brought to Lincoln Medical Center. She died on April 27, 2020, hours before her husband, who also died of COVID-19. She was 73 years old.","She overcame everything. Cancer. Two car accidents, including one when she was hit by a semi-truck.

After serving in the United States Air Force from 1952 to 1956, Howell worked in the Garment District, honing his skills as a tailor and dressmaker. In the 1990s, he met Laura Taylor, a health care worker and single mother of three. Howell fell in love, marrying Taylor and adopting her children. “We don’t do ‘step’ in my family,” said his daughter, Marisa Taylor. She described Howell as an “even-keeled” father, never overbearing, although “he would go into protection mode” from time to time. Howell was a jazz aficionado and voracious reader who was “always trying to find something new.” Even into his 80s, he was learning new languages, his family said. In the spring of 2020, he and his wife contracted the novel coronavirus. While the two were roomed separately at Lincoln Medical Center in The Bronx, they both died hours apart on April 27, 2020.

Terio was gregarious, and a familiar face to many in Jackson Heights, where he lived, his family said. And he became known for giving people second chances: When he retired in the late 1990’s, Terio took on two recovering addicts to drive his trucks. It was a decision, his family said, that he never regretted. Terio died March 31 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Queens. He was 86 years old.",Everybody knew Tony when he pulled up.

Jackson, who suffered from several underlying conditions including lupus and diabetes, died from COVID-19 on April 7, 2020, at Einstein in the Bronx. She is survived by her brother; her son, Damian; and his family, and the “Village,” a close-knit group of friends.","Pat was extremely giving of herself, very forthcoming, she didn’t pull punches.

Years later, he would return to lead the worship service in song and prayer. His devotion, which included waking up at 5 a.m. to pray as well as spending hours composing worship songs, stemmed primarily from a “humble” desire to be a “servant of God,” said his wife, Barbara Rivera. Rivera also worked as a registrar at the Jamaica Hospital, and was often fetching blankets or telling jokes to patients, his family said. Rivera was called “mayor of the hospital” by friends and family and he found time to regularly send flowers to his wife and mother and call his three children and two step-children.

He was weeks away from graduation and planned on becoming a social studies teacher at a charter school, his family said. Portillo was passionate about education and came from a long line of educators. He was the “glue” of his Honduran-American family, said his cousin, Wendy Portillo-Speer, and was always there for his loved ones, both friends and family. Portillo-Speer said her cousin helped her stay on track in school during a rebellious teenage period and even accompanied her to her 8th grade prom. He enjoyed karaoke, traveling, trying out new food and was known for his contagious laugh and heart of gold, Portillo-Speer said. Portillo died on April 14, 2020, at Lincoln Medical Center at the age of 37.

Pompa was a family man, his wife said, who enjoyed spending time with his five children: Alexa, Crysta, Mark, Nicolette and Stefani. If the kids were home for the summer,” Cilione said, “we always stayed home with them, so we could be together as a family.” A die-hard Yankees fan, Pompa would take his family to games at Yankee Stadium whenever he could. He also regularly took his children out to eat, indulging in icees at Ralph’s. When Stefani Wren, Lisa’s daughter who Pompa helped raise, broke her arm and needed a cast, Pompa would put on his bathing suit and help her wash her hair in the shower. He would go by the name, “Francois the hairdresser.” He also regularly pressed his daughters’ clothes, drove them to school and picked them up when the day was over. While Pompa would occasionally dance along to trendy pop songs, there was no musician he loved more than Frank Sinatra. His favorite songs were “My Way” and “The Way You Look Tonight,” which he danced to with his daughter, Nicolette, at her first communion.

Running the restaurant in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, led him to develop a lung condition, his family said.

Garvin was raised in Baltimore and moved to Brooklyn when she was 23 years old. There, and later in the Bronx, she raised two children. Outside the home, everyone called her, “Ms. Karen” and “Ms. G,” as a sign of respect, said her colleague, Rachel Sherrow. As the coordinator for City Meals on Wheels at Mid-Bronx Senior Council, Garvin oversaw regular food delivery to hundreds of residents in the Bronx, working long hours, six days a week and every Thanksgiving and other holidays. She gave “people opportunities who would not normally have opportunities, ex-cons and former drug addicts,” Hipps said. Garvin, who was described as a free spirit and avid reader by her family, died on April 10 at NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville after a weekslong battle with the virus. She was 63.","She was kind, generous and totally dedicated.

Every summer, he would host a back-to-school block party with DJ and grill, offering free haircuts to children. Hammett believed in the power of prayer and community and thought that everyone should have a second chance, his family said. He liked to mingle, and invited people to attend Little Widow's Mite Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon. Hammett also volunteered with his son, LeShawn Hammett, to coach the Penn State Wilkes-Barre basketball team, leading them to a championship in March 2019. He was a proud coach, his family said, as he talked about his players and showed off his championship ring. Hammett was caring and honest — at times, too much so, said his grandson, Chris Lewis. Lewis, who was raised by Hammett, recalls watching “The Lion King” with his grandfather years ago. After seeing Simba’s father, Mufasa, dying, Lewis turned to Hammett and asked if, one day, if he was going to die. “I’m not a lion,” he said. “No one lives forever, but I’m going to be here forever.” Hammett died March 30, 2020, at Lincoln Medical Center at the age of 71.","My dad was one of those guys that if he could find a way to make it work for you, he would.","Chris Lewis, Leroy Hammett’s grandson",Justin Yip,4/19/2020 2:34:06,Leroy,,,Hammett,71,,3/30/2020,Bronx,"320 Morris Avenue, Apt. 4B",10451.0,https://gothamist.com/news/death-beloved-bronx-barber-coronavirus-underscores-wider-loss-community-foundation,WNYC,"Barber, assistant basketball coach",Leroy's Unisex; Pennsylvania State University Wilkes-Barre,,,Diabetes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tP1Z1hIZJ8ipV5Jt0DoLjTwq95wmltin,Hammett family,Son LeShawn Hammett,,,Male,,,,,Bronx,Bronx,NY,320 Morris Ave,4B,10451.0,,,,

,,,TRUE,,,,,,,,,City employee,Metropolitan Transportation Authority,2/23/21,Harold_Solomon.png,"Harold John Solomon Jr., was a native Staten Islander. He and his wife, Ruth, bought and moved into her parents’ house when they got married 55 years ago. In that house, they raised their four children, and Hal instilled in his kids a sense of fairness, matching whatever they could save to buy their first cars, his family said. Yet his plan fell away when his granddaughters got their driver’s licenses, and he bought them new cars straightaway. After spending a few years in the U.S. Army out of high school, Hal spent much of his career as an MTA bus driver. The job didn't fit his temperament, as he generally had little patience and was decidedly “not a people person,” his family said. But he had other hobbies: Hal was an enthusiastic regular in the local baseball world, managing three or four teams at a time, and gave every kid “a fair shake.” Despite being frequently in and out of the hospital in the last few years of his life, he always worried more about his wife’s health than his own, his family said. He died at Richmond University Medical Center on April 8, 2020, at the age of 80.","They were very, very content with the life they had — their home, their family. And that’s all they wanted, and that’s all they needed.","Laura Reuter, Harold John Solomon Jr.’s daughter",Hannah Reale,4/13/2020 12:31:19,Harold,John,,Solomon,80,Jr.,4/8/2020,Staten Island,30 Delaware Avenue,10304.0,,,Bus operator,MTA,https://obits.silive.com/obituaries/siadvance/obituary.aspx?n=harold-john-solomon&pid=195929067&fhid=21933,Hanley Funeral Home,Unknown,,,"Wife: Ruth Solomon, daughters, Patricia Hotte (George), Laura Reuter (Richard), son, Steven Solomon",,,Male,,,,,Staten Island,Staten Island,NY,30 Delaware Ave,,10304.0,,,,

,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,TRUE ,City employee,Fire Department of New York,,Albert_Petrocelli.jpg,"Albert “Al” Petrocelli Sr. met his wife, Ginger, when they were teenagers frequenting Brooklyn ice cream parlors like Herman’s and The Sweet Shop. They married in 1967 at the Brooklyn Chancery. A week later, Petrocelli was deployed to Vietnam with the U.S. Army, according to the Staten Island Advance.
