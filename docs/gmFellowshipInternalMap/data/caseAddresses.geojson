She enjoyed riding roller coasters into her 60s, loved The Golden Girls and Harlequin novels and “had a hunger to live,” her daughter said. Menard moved to Florida and returned to New York City in 2019. She had early onset dementia, though was still active with a companion. Menard contracted COVID-19 at the early onset of the pandemic. She was admitted to Long Island Jewish Hospital and there was a staff shortage so Gisele’s daughter, Christie, a nurse, helped care for her mother and checked her vital signs until April 10.

A week later she returned to her home in Florida just long enough to pack her bags to move to Mexico. Though Ollarvide had a degree in drafting when he moved to the U.S., some of his first jobs were working at a fruit stand and as a busboy in a hotel restaurant. He eventually started his own drafting company and became an American citizen in 1999. He had been receiving cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering but was improving when he contracted COVID-19. He played golf twice a week with the same group of friends; was in a men’s tennis league; and ran his business remotely throughout his treatment. Ollarvide was a favorite at his local bar and was described as a jokester, his family said. He often used the hashtag #Juaninamillion on his social media posts, which his family and friends adopted as their own. Ollarvide died April 20 at Harlem Hospital at the age of 60.

Barbato Jr. was born and raised in Tomkinsville, attended Curtis High School and moved to Westerleigh in the early 1970s, where he lived until his death. After graduating high school, Barbato went into carpentry and founded his own contracting company, LJB Associates. A craftsman and designer, Barbato was nicknamed “MacGyver” by those who knew him, because “he could build or fix anything,” said his daughter, Jennifer DeMeo. After a decade running LJB, Barbato became a design contractor for a national chain of cosmetology schools. In the 1990s, he went on to join the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development as a building inspector. Ever social, Barbato enjoyed traveling, dining out, and attending Broadway shows. He also took pleasure in teaching others woodworking and often had projects going in the homes of neighbors and friends. When he was a young man, Barbato once passed a burning house on his way to work, and made sure that everyone inside escaped. “He did whatever he could to help people, whoever it was: neighbor, friend, family member, stranger,” his daughter said. After retiring 11 years ago, Barbato took a part-time maintenance job at a funeral home, where he was most likely exposed to the novel coronavirus. Barbato died April 7 at the age of 74 at Staten Island University Hospital.

Thompson picked cotton with his aunt rather than attend school, leaving scars on his legs. At the age of 9, he left Williston, S.C., and moved to Brooklyn with his father. He became a star athlete, leading his high school basketball team to a championship game at Madison Square Garden. Thompson played college basketball in Kansas and, after graduating, worked at the Walt Whitman Houses, a NYCHA housing complex in Fort Greene. “He had a very deep feeling for his people, and people who were poor,” said his wife of more than 40 years, Dolores B. Thompson. Thompson, known to his students as “Mr. T or JT,” worked as a teacher in a daycare center and later in a classroom support role at PS 67 for 40 years. Often, before his shift started, he’d ride his bike from his home in Prospect Heights to Fort Greene so he could greet each child at the school breakfast program. Outside of class, Thompson loved to sing or “hit the notes,” as he’d say. He helped establish the Fort Greene Council Inc. with his mentor Sam Pinn Jr., lobbying for more Black stewardship of community institutions, namely care centers for children and seniors, and worked with Brooklyn CORE (Congress on Racial Equity). Thompson died May 17 at the Cobble Hill Care Center, after suffering from kidney failure, Alzheimer’s and finally Covid-19. His wife was by his side as he died. “I had all his music on the iPod.

Antonio was resourceful and never wanted anything to go to waste, according to his son, E.J. Antonio. He repaired abandoned bicycles and donated them to local children, friends and strangers. Antonio “could establish relationships with strangers that felt as though they had lasted a lifetime,” E.J. said. “He had a way of connecting with others that made them feel seen and acknowledged.” Antonio also was naturally funny and was known for his “joke of the day.” His friends would send him jokes, simply because they wanted to hear him tell them with his special flair. Around the holidays, Antonio dressed up as Santa and visited schools and nursing homes in Brooklyn. It was his favorite way to give back, said his son, as he could do so anonymously.

Hammett believed in the power of prayer and community and thought that everyone should have a second chance, his family said. He liked to mingle, and invited people to attend Little Widow's Mite Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon. Hammett also volunteered with his son, LeShawn Hammett, to coach the Penn State Wilkes-Barre basketball team, leading them to a championship in March 2019. He was a proud coach, his family said, as he talked about his players and showed off his championship ring. Hammett was caring and honest — at times, too much so, said his grandson, Chris Lewis. Lewis, who was raised by Hammett, recalls watching “The Lion King” with his grandfather years ago. After seeing Simba’s father, Mufasa, dying, Lewis turned to Hammett and asked if, one day, if he was going to die. “I’m not a lion,” he said. “No one lives forever, but I’m going to be here forever.” Hammett died March 30, 2020, at Lincoln Medical Center at the age of 71.", "hardCodedPullquote": "My dad was one of those guys that if he could find a way to make it work for you, he would.", "pullquoteSource": "Chris Lewis, Leroy Hammett’s grandson", "author": "Justin Yip", "timestamp": "4\/19\/2020 2:34:06", "firstName": "Leroy", "middleName": null, "nickname": null, "lastName": "Hammett", "age": "71", "suffix": null, "deathDate": "3\/30\/2020", "borough": "Bronx", "streetAddress": "320 Morris Avenue, Apt. 4B", "zipCode": 10451.0, "newsURL": "https:\/\/gothamist.com\/news\/death-beloved-bronx-barber-coronavirus-underscores-wider-loss-community-foundation", "newsSource": "WNYC", "jobTitle": "Barber, assistant basketball coach", "employer": "Leroy's Unisex; Pennsylvania State University Wilkes-Barre", "obitURL": null, "obitSource": null, "underlyingCondition": "Diabetes", "uploadPhoto": "https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=1tP1Z1hIZJ8ipV5Jt0DoLjTwq95wmltin", "photoSource": "Hammett family", "additionalNotes": "Son LeShawn Hammett", "honorific": null, "email": null, "gender": "Male", "covidStatus": null, "writer": null, "FromCommunityCallout?": null, "sourceNote": null, "geocoding_borough": "Bronx", "geocoding_city": "Bronx", "geocoding_state": "NY", "geocoding_street_address": "320 Morris Ave", "geocoding_apt": "4B", "geocoding_zip": "10451", "address_name": null, "other_addresses": null, "address_notes": null, "Unnamed: 57": null, "fullAddress": "320 Morris Ave, Bronx, NY, 10451" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -73.9252585, 40.8130898 ] } },

Yet his plan fell away when his granddaughters got their driver’s licenses, and he bought them new cars straightaway. After spending a few years in the U.S. Army out of high school, Hal spent much of his career as an MTA bus driver. The job didn't fit his temperament, as he generally had little patience and was decidedly “not a people person,” his family said. But he had other hobbies: Hal was an enthusiastic regular in the local baseball world, managing three or four teams at a time, and gave every kid “a fair shake.” Despite being frequently in and out of the hospital in the last few years of his life, he always worried more about his wife’s health than his own, his family said.
