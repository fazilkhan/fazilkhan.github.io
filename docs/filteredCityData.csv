Menard settled in Queens Village with her then-husband and children, working as a nurse at Franklin Nursing Home in Flushing, Queens. She treated her kid’s friends like they were her own children and almost everyone in Queens Village knew her, said her daughter, Christie Bruno.

She loved going on cruises — and if you couldn’t find her on the ship, she was at the casino. She enjoyed riding roller coasters into her 60s, loved The Golden Girls and Harlequin novels and “had a hunger to live,” her daughter said. Menard moved to Florida and returned to New York City in 2019. She had early onset dementia, though was still active with a companion. Menard contracted COVID-19 at the early onset of the pandemic. She was admitted to Long Island Jewish Hospital and there was a staff shortage so Gisele’s daughter, Christie, a nurse, helped care for her mother and checked her vital signs until April 10.

He immigrated to the United States in 1984 after meeting his wife, Sally, in the Cancun airport. She was trying to rent a car and he was selling transport tickets. He called her the next day and, after two dates, suggested she delay her flight home. “He said, ‘We’re getting along so well, why don’t you stay another week?’” Sally said. She did. A week later she returned to her home in Florida just long enough to pack her bags to move to Mexico. Though Ollarvide had a degree in drafting when he moved to the U.S., some of his first jobs were working at a fruit stand and as a busboy in a hotel restaurant. He eventually started his own drafting company and became an American citizen in 1999. He had been receiving cancer treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering but was improving when he contracted COVID-19. He played golf twice a week with the same group of friends; was in a men’s tennis league; and ran his business remotely throughout his treatment. Ollarvide was a favorite at his local bar and was described as a jokester, his family said.

The oldest of six children, he grew up in Oakwood, graduated from New Dorp High School and married his high school sweetheart, Linda Filippelli. After working as a sheet-metal mechanic, Arbeeny founded the Verrazano Fence Co. and ran it for 40 years. Arbeeny’s daughter, Danielle Messina, said her father loved going to the Jersey Shore to watch doo-wop groups and was a league bowler at Rab’s in New Dorp. He loved fishing and caught a record-breaking 48-pound bass in the Verrazano Narrows. A popular figure on Staten Island, Arbeeny could also be tough; his brother, Michael Arbeeny, recalled that once, when a customer refused to pay for a fence, Arbeeny connected it to his truck and dragged it down the street. When he died on April 25, Arbeeny was living in Clove Lakes Health Care and Rehabilitation Center on Staten Island. He had diabetes and was on kidney dialysis, but, his daughter said, “He was doing fantastic.” He went from chatting on the phone with her daily to dying in just six days.

Specializing in hard-edge paintings, Kaplan exhibited his work five times at the 55 Mercer Street Gallery, which he helped to establish in 1969. His work was recognized with grants from the Adolph & Esther Gottlieb Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Kaplan combined his painting career with his leftist politics through his membership with the Art Workers' Coalition, a collective of artists, writers and critics who advocated for economic, political and social reforms at New York City’s museums. He also taught a new generation of artists at several colleges and universities. A Brooklyn native, Kaplan called SoHo home before moving to the Hebrew Home in Riverdale. There, friends say, the 84-year-old regaled fellow residents with funny stories and a sharp wit. At the time of his death, Kaplan continued to paint, working on a series dedicated to his longtime partner.

After receiving his degree, he set up a private practice in Manhattan, which he ran for decades. At a young age, Dr. Galst developed an interest in coin collecting, a passion that he continued to pursue throughout his life, becoming an expert in coins related to the eye (as well as those from Judea). He wrote a 574-page book on the subject titled “Ophthalmologia, Optica et Visio in Nummis.” He was a clinical professor at New York Medical College and past president and longtime board member of the New York Numismatic Club. Dr. Galst and his wife, psychologist Joann Paley Galst, met as children and became best friends while working on their high school yearbook. Dr. Galst was drawn to ophthalmology by the concrete nature and specificity of the field, she said, viewing the eyes as “a window to the well-being of a person.” As someone who valued family, Dr. Galst often saw patients across generations, treating the children of those who had first come to him when they were young themselves. Dr. Galst died April 12 at the age of 69 at NYU Langone Hospital in Manhattan. He is survived by his wife, their son, and two grandchildren, one of whom was born shortly after his death.","He was the ultimate mensch, a very kind and generous person who gave of his time to anyone who needed or wanted it.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1/14/21,Theresa_Estelle_Morris.png,"A lifelong Brooklyn resident, Theresa Estelle Morris was a mother to three, a grandmother to five, and a great-grandmother to 10. After a stint working in a Brooklyn pearl factory, Morris became a homemaker after marrying John Morris, who served in the military and was from Brooklyn. While her husband worked as an NYPD officer, Morris and her three children spent the summers at the family home in upstate New York. Those days were “pure joy” for her, according to her son, William Morris. “It was so cute how happy she was to be there,” he said. “She just enjoyed it so much.” After her husband died in 2004, Morris lived in Waterford on the Bay, an assisted living home. She enjoyed bingo and dances and lovingly described the home as a “cruise ship going nowhere,” a far cry from her work in the pearl factory. Morris suffered with COVID-like symptoms for more than a month and was transferred between several nursing homes and hospitals before she died April 6 in Coney Island Hospital at the age of 91. Her cremated remains will be buried at Calverton Military Cemetery with her husband, John.","She was a good mom, and a good grandma.

I found the address above on a Spokeo search. I have included it even though MRNY does not have a program in the Bronx since it is possible that Mr. Castillo moved from the Bronx to one of the three boroughs/Long Island where MRNY does have programs. The obituary in MRNY shows Mr. Castillo as a member of MRNY. 

I listed Mr. Castillo's age as 50 above; he appears to be in the 40's/50's age ranges based on his photo in MRNY.

I was not able to upload Mr. Castillo's photo from MRNY website (but it appears on the volunteer Google doc).

I was not able to find Mr. Castillo's date of death.

It is unclear from the obituary on MRNY if it was written by a family member or a friend; it's possible that it was written by his wife. Mr. Castillo had 4 children. His obituary on MRNY says, ""Juan was a husband, wonderful father of 4 adorable children of whom was his moral and economic support"".",,,Male,,Phyllis Kaufman,No,,Bronx,Bronx,NY,Rowland St,,<NA>,,,,,"Rowland St, Bronx, NY, <NA>","Rowland St, Bronx, NY 10461, USA",40.8389862,-73.8474445,POINT (-73.84744449999999 40.8389862)

I found the address above on a Spokeo search. Based on Ms. Perez's photo on MRNY, 72 would be the right age range (although it may be too young based on the obituary description of Ms. Perez in  MRNY). The reference to a previous address in Puerto Rico could connect to the MRNY obituary, which notes that Ms. Perez "". . . was a pioneer of our family in the USA"", perhaps indicating that she immigrated to the US.

I could not upload Ms. Perez's photo (but it appears on the volunteer Google doc).

I could not find Ms. Perez's date of death.

It is unclear whether a family member or friend wrote Ms. Perez's obituary on MRNY; she is the sister of a member of MRNY.

I am unable to upload Mr. Mena's photo from MRNY (but it appears on the volunteer Google doc).

I was not able to find Mr. Mena's date of death.

The obituary on MRNY was written by Mr. Mena's child (one of his children); he also has grand children. Mr. Mena's child in the MRNY obituary said, ""My dad was the best man in the world, a good father, a good grandfather, adorable, loved by everyone who knew him.

The only white pages search that seems to provide a relevant resource for Carlos Ortiz at 370 Bushwick Avenue, Apartment 1G, Brooklyn, NY 11206-3733, 718.573.0944. The age range could be accurate (75). The list of relatives linked Carlos Ortiz to Gloria Ortiz. Gloria Ortiz’s age range could be accurate (67), and I was able to find a marriage license for Carlos Ortiz and Gloria Ortiz in 1963. I was not able to find any relevant searches for Gloria Ortiz. this is the address that I listed above.

The obituary on MRNY is from his wife, who says that they were married for 50 years.

Rosalie Acampora, 83, was loving, caring, and creative, and she always had a smile on her face. She was originally from Brooklyn, where she attended Lafayette High School. She later earned a degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology and got a job in retail buying. She moved to Staten Island in 1968 and raised her children there. She was an active part of her children’s lives, even holding the title of PTA President at Port Richmond High School for several years. Rosalie loved giving back to the community; she literally once gave a homeless man the coat off of her back. She helped deliver toys to local organizations, such as Toys for Tots. Outside of giving and caring for her mother, children, and grandchildren, Rosalie loved sewing, painting, singing, and needlepoint. She is survived by her two sisters, Antoinette and Connie, her four children Marie, Anne, Alice, and Anthony, as well as her 10 grandchildren. She led an incredible life and is loved and missed by all who knew her.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thomas_Crater.png,"Thomas Crater Jr. was an activist and entrepreneur who published and edited his own local newspaper called The New York Page. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Crater lived in Jamaica, Queens, for more than 50 years. He worked for several major news organizations including Jet, Ebony and Black Enterprise and dreamed of starting his own business. In 1984, Crater began publishing The New York Page, a newspaper that served Jamaica, Queens. Always a free paper, The New York Page ran for more than three decades. Known by many as “TC,” Crater was a sharp dresser who never wore jeans and liked wing-tipped shoes, white shirts and bowties. Up until he became sick with COVID-19, he took care of his sister, Edna Mae; fought for improvements in his apartment building; distributed a free local paper; and served as an usher for 40 years at his church. Crater, who died April 29 at Columbia Presbyterian at the age of 75, is survived by his sister, two daughters and two grandchildren. In 2018, Crater suffered a stroke. But after he recovered, he continued to care for his sister, began volunteering at a church soup kitchen and even rode his foldable bike to the farmer’s market against doctor’s orders.",He really believed in people.

Barbato Jr. was born and raised in Tomkinsville, attended Curtis High School and moved to Westerleigh in the early 1970s, where he lived until his death. After graduating high school, Barbato went into carpentry and founded his own contracting company, LJB Associates. A craftsman and designer, Barbato was nicknamed “MacGyver” by those who knew him, because “he could build or fix anything,” said his daughter, Jennifer DeMeo. After a decade running LJB, Barbato became a design contractor for a national chain of cosmetology schools. In the 1990s, he went on to join the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development as a building inspector. Ever social, Barbato enjoyed traveling, dining out, and attending Broadway shows. He also took pleasure in teaching others woodworking and often had projects going in the homes of neighbors and friends. When he was a young man, Barbato once passed a burning house on his way to work, and made sure that everyone inside escaped. “He did whatever he could to help people, whoever it was: neighbor, friend, family member, stranger,” his daughter said. After retiring 11 years ago, Barbato took a part-time maintenance job at a funeral home, where he was most likely exposed to the novel coronavirus. Barbato died April 7 at the age of 74 at Staten Island University Hospital. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Jean (DePete), two daughters, five grandchildren and two great-granddaughters.","My dad’s motto was ‘family first.’ He had a tattoo of it in Italian on his wrist, ‘familia prima.’ And for him, everyone was family.

Thompson played college basketball in Kansas and, after graduating, worked at the Walt Whitman Houses, a NYCHA housing complex in Fort Greene. “He had a very deep feeling for his people, and people who were poor,” said his wife of more than 40 years, Dolores B.

Often, before his shift started, he’d ride his bike from his home in Prospect Heights to Fort Greene so he could greet each child at the school breakfast program. Outside of class, Thompson loved to sing or “hit the notes,” as he’d say. He helped establish the Fort Greene Council Inc. with his mentor Sam Pinn Jr., lobbying for more Black stewardship of community institutions, namely care centers for children and seniors, and worked with Brooklyn CORE (Congress on Racial Equity).

At 19, she immigrated to the U.S., paving the way for her immediate family who would later follow. While living in Brooklyn, she married Tito Mero, a fellow Ecuadorian immigrant. They raised three children and later settled in Queens. Mero had a career as a hairdresser and tailor; she was also the family matriarch, said her daughter, Diana Mero-Tasci. “She was there for me when I delivered my first child. She stayed there through the night to make sure I and the baby were OK.” Mero loved walking on the beach and feeling the sun on her skin, her family said. She took pride in her tomato garden and also had a knack for making new friends. Mero fought metastatic breast cancer and diabetes for years before getting sick with COVID-19. She died April 19 at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center at the age of 77.","She was a great mom who loved life, family and friends.

As a kid, Agovino teamed up with his cousin, Danny, to cut Mets coupons out of milk cartons until they saved enough to attend a game, said his sisterm Toni Agovino. He was also fascinated by trains. Agovino loved the city’s subways and had a special knack for giving his friends and family exact instructions on how to navigate the MTA system. Agovino once competed on “The $64,000 Question,” a television quiz show in the 1960s and drove a taxi through the late 1980s. He had a wicked sense of humor, his sister said, and loved hanging out with his family. “He had a special relationship with each one of us,” she said. Agovino enjoyed going to baseball games with his brother and he remembered all of his siblings’ birthdays. One of his greatest accomplishments was taking care of his elderly mother. Agovino died April 4 at Jacobi Hospital at the age of 67.

Before his daughter, Lauren Dazzo-Hanley, left the house, he would check her tires and warn her to back out slowly and look for nails. A doting grandfather, Dazzo hid toys in between couch cushions, so his youngest grandchild wouldn’t put them in her mouth. He’d leave folded up paper towels all over his daughter's house, just in case he needed one. When someone needed a ride, the answer was always yes, even if it meant waiting in the car for hours. Dazzo loved to cook meals for his family, even as he battled with Parkinson’s disease, and he insisted on making oatmeal for his grandchildren, his family said. A few months before Dazzo died, his daughter noticed that he started singing, “Skip To My Lou” including the chorus: “Flies in the buttermilk, shoo, shoo, shoo.” Dazzo died April 9 at the age of 73.","He was the most gentle man I know, patient, honest, a great cook.","Lauren Dazzo-Hanley, Anthony C.

Born in a small village in Paphos, Cyprus, Panayiotou moved to New York to attend Queens College. He worked as a busboy, then as a waiter and finally, as a restaurant manager, until he opened Gee Whiz in 1989. Running the restaurant in the years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, led him to develop a lung condition, his family said.

Garvin was raised in Baltimore and moved to Brooklyn when she was 23 years old. There, and later in the Bronx, she raised two children. Outside the home, everyone called her, “Ms. Karen” and “Ms. G,” as a sign of respect, said her colleague, Rachel Sherrow. As the coordinator for City Meals on Wheels at Mid-Bronx Senior Council, Garvin oversaw regular food delivery to hundreds of residents in the Bronx, working long hours, six days a week and every Thanksgiving and other holidays. She gave “people opportunities who would not normally have opportunities, ex-cons and former drug addicts,” Hipps said. Garvin, who was described as a free spirit and avid reader by her family, died on April 10 at NewYork-Presbyterian Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville after a weekslong battle with the virus. She was 63.","She was kind, generous and totally dedicated.

,,,,,True,,,,,,,,,,Ralph_Martel.jpeg,"Ralph William Martel Jr. rendered vivid sculptures made of metal and wood. He believed art and artistry belonged to the working class — not solely to the rich who could afford his pieces, his family said. Martel, a studio art professor at the College of Staten Island, lived in an “artist’s home” on Bethune Street in the West Village and was known for hosting parties.

After Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Ed and his wife, Paula, stayed in their home in the Rockaways to help feed clean-up workers and watch the homes of their neighbors who had been forced to flee — all while enduring their own power outage. Antonio was resourceful and never wanted anything to go to waste, according to his son, E.J. Antonio. He repaired abandoned bicycles and donated them to local children, friends and strangers. Antonio “could establish relationships with strangers that felt as though they had lasted a lifetime,” E.J. said. “He had a way of connecting with others that made them feel seen and acknowledged.” Antonio also was naturally funny and was known for his “joke of the day.” His friends would send him jokes, simply because they wanted to hear him tell them with his special flair. Around the holidays, Antonio dressed up as Santa and visited schools and nursing homes in Brooklyn. It was his favorite way to give back, said his son, as he could do so anonymously.

Every summer, he would host a back-to-school block party with DJ and grill, offering free haircuts to children. Hammett believed in the power of prayer and community and thought that everyone should have a second chance, his family said. He liked to mingle, and invited people to attend Little Widow's Mite Baptist Church, where he served as a deacon. Hammett also volunteered with his son, LeShawn Hammett, to coach the Penn State Wilkes-Barre basketball team, leading them to a championship in March 2019. He was a proud coach, his family said, as he talked about his players and showed off his championship ring. Hammett was caring and honest — at times, too much so, said his grandson, Chris Lewis. Lewis, who was raised by Hammett, recalls watching “The Lion King” with his grandfather years ago. After seeing Simba’s father, Mufasa, dying, Lewis turned to Hammett and asked if, one day, if he was going to die. “I’m not a lion,” he said. “No one lives forever, but I’m going to be here forever.” Hammett died March 30, 2020, at Lincoln Medical Center at the age of 71.","My dad was one of those guys that if he could find a way to make it work for you, he would.","Chris Lewis, Leroy Hammett’s grandson",Justin Yip,4/19/2020 2:34:06,Leroy,,,Hammett,71,,3/30/2020,Bronx,"320 Morris Avenue, Apt. 4B",10451.0,https://gothamist.com/news/death-beloved-bronx-barber-coronavirus-underscores-wider-loss-community-foundation,WNYC,"Barber, assistant basketball coach",Leroy's Unisex; Pennsylvania State University Wilkes-Barre,,,Diabetes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tP1Z1hIZJ8ipV5Jt0DoLjTwq95wmltin,Hammett family,Son LeShawn Hammett,,,Male,,,,,Bronx,Bronx,NY,320 Morris Ave,4B,10451,,,,,"320 Morris Ave, Bronx, NY, 10451","320 Morris Ave, Bronx, NY 10451, USA",40.8130898,-73.9252585,POINT (-73.9252585 40.8130898)

He and his wife, Ruth, bought and moved into her parents’ house when they got married 55 years ago. In that house, they raised their four children, and Hal instilled in his kids a sense of fairness, matching whatever they could save to buy their first cars, his family said. Yet his plan fell away when his granddaughters got their driver’s licenses, and he bought them new cars straightaway. After spending a few years in the U.S. Army out of high school, Hal spent much of his career as an MTA bus driver. The job didn't fit his temperament, as he generally had little patience and was decidedly “not a people person,” his family said. But he had other hobbies: Hal was an enthusiastic regular in the local baseball world, managing three or four teams at a time, and gave every kid “a fair shake.” Despite being frequently in and out of the hospital in the last few years of his life, he always worried more about his wife’s health than his own, his family said. He died at Richmond University Medical Center on April 8, 2020, at the age of 80.","They were very, very content with the life they had — their home, their family.
