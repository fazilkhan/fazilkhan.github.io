  '<p>“A lot of trees fell and enclosed us. It was so scary, and there was no electricity, no water, no food or fuel, no communication for almost a year,” Soto, 23, said. “It took us eight or nine months to fix the house. And even today, there are so many people still using blue plastic tents instead of proper roofs because they couldn’t rebuild,” she said in an interview four years on.</p>' +
  '<p>The result was a large exodus of Puerto Ricans from the archipelago to the US mainland. Puerto Ricans have been migrating to the mainland for decades, but in the last few years, the levels of emigration have been significant.</p>' +
  '<p>The devastation caused by Hurricane Maria exacerbated deep-rooted problems already present on the territory, including a poverty rate four times the national average and a pre-pandemic unemployment rate nearly three times higher than the national figure.</p>' +
  '<p>The already fragile real estate market was among the most heavily affected. With many unable or unwilling to rebuild their homes, there has been a surge in abandoned, vacant houses across the island followed as people emigrated to restart their lives.</p>' +
