                    <p>Why does it matter that so many of these colleges don’t look like their state’s graduating high school classes? Public flagships were created to educate the residents of their states and most make that explicit. The University of South Carolina’s <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/institutional_research_assessment_and_analytics/about_us/mission_statements/usc_campus_mission_statements.php#:~:text=USC%20Columbia%20Mission%20Statement&text=state's%20citizens%20through%20teaching%2C%20research,creative%20activity%2C%20and%20community%20engagement.&text=promote%20the%20dissemination%20of%20knowledge,an%20enhanced%20quality%20of%20life.&text=campuses%20(Lancaster%2C%20Salkehatchie%2C%20Sumter%2C%20and%20Union)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission statement</a>, for example, begins, “The primary mission of the University of South Carolina Columbia is the education of the state’s citizens through teaching, research, creative activity, and community engagement.” Still, it has the third largest gap for Black students in the country.</p>
                    <p>State flagships are funded by residents’ tax dollars, and last year they enrolled a combined 1.1 million undergraduate students. Many states have other high-quality state universities, but the flagships often have the most resources, the best graduation rates and graduates’ salaries, and powerful alumni networks that help can launch students’ careers.</p>
